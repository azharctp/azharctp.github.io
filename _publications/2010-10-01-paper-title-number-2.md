title: "A physics-informed neural network for turbulent wake simulations behind wind turbines"
collection: publications

excerpt: "This paper is about developing a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) model to simulate wind turbine wakes efficiently, using less simulation data. The model, tested against traditional solvers and field data, shows similar accuracy to Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models. A transfer learning strategy accelerates training by 5×, demonstrating the PINN's potential to replace traditional solvers."
