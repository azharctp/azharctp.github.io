title: "On the training efficiency of shallow architectures for physics informed neural networks"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This paper is about Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and how shallow networks converge faster than deeper ones for the same error characteristics. Using the 1D Poisson equation, it shows that shallow architectures lead to faster convergence, with experimental results supporting this.'
