Work experience
======
* Assistant Manager Operations (June 2015 â€“ March 2019): Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited
  * Created internal control of day-to-day transactions and punctually opened and closed business activities.
  * Taught employees how to collaborate on daily tasks and achievement of service targets. Effective time management reduced working hours by 20% and thereby eliminating overtime.
  * Coordinated with the engineering and projects (E&P) team to revamp the six-bay tank lorry filling gantry (TLFG) to 8 bays without affecting retail operations and while upgrading tank farm and gantry automation by LnT.
  * Helped a team of 20 maintain business professionalism by coaching each on methods for delivering exceptional service to every customer.
  * Accomplished objectives by undertaking department activities during the absence of the line manager.
  * Handled different areas of work such as Maintenance, HSSE (Health, Safety, Security, and Environment), and planning and supply. 

Projects
======
### M.Tech Project: Guide: Dr. Kameswararao Anupindi
* A Three-Dimensional Simulation of Non-Newtonian Blood Flow Through Irregular Arteries Using Off-Lattice Boltzmann Method
  *  Developed off-lattice Boltzmann solver in three-dimensional cylindrical coordinates to simulate non-Newtonian blood flows under pulsatile conditions.
  * Systematically investigated the effect of the degree of surface irregularity of the stenosis and the shear-thinning effect of blood on the flow dynamics.

### B. Tech Project: Guide: Dr. Unnikrishnan M
* Vibrational Analysis of Flow Through Pipes
  * Determined the fundamental frequency of vibration of viscoelastic polyurethane pipe without mass, with added mass, and with flow.
  * Validated the analytical data and results obtained using ANSYS fluid-structure interaction simulation with that from the experimental data.
