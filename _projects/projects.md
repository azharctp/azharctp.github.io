The dataset used for the problem is **'State/UT-wise Accidents Classified According to Type of Traffic Violations during 2018'**

## Bar plot and line plot 
<br/><img src='/images/data_vis.png'>
By analysing the data, the numbers for the cases due to overspeeding is very high compared to others. So it is good to plot the same separately. From the above plot, it can be inferred that number of accidents due to overspeeding is high in 6 states, crossing 20,000 cases. The number of injuries due to overspeeding is more than the number of cases in some states which shows that more than single person was injured in some accidents, it can be co-passengers or third-party. In some states such as Bihar, Punjab, the number of deaths to the total cases ratio is higher. The same is evident from the plot as the number of death pointer lies in the upper part of the bar representing number of cases.  

## Line plot

In this plot, the number deaths by accidents due to causes other than overspeeding is analysed. The accidents caused by 'Jumping red light' is having less number of death toll compared to others. The statistics of UP is alarming as the deaths due to three violations, 'drunken driving/consumption of alcohol & drug', 'driving on wrong side' and 'use of mobile phone' is very high eventhough overspeeding cases were less as seen previously. 'Driving on wrong side' is a major cause of death in mant states. This must be due to head-on collision due to traffic coming from the opposite direction which can be fatal.

## Scatter Plot

The above scatter plot shows that certain states or UTs are ranked high in all cases and some others ranked low in all cases. This can be a reflection of the stringent and lenient following of traffic rules is those states. Ranking of overspeeding and driving on wrong side goes in a similar trend in most cases.

## Box Plot
Dataset used is **'Sub Divisional Monthly Rainfall from 1901 to 2017'**
<br/><img src='/images/data_vis.png'>

The boxplot shows that the rainfall for the period from June to September for South-Indian subdivisions. Costal Karnataka receives the highest during the period followed by Kerala. The horizontal line represents the median and green triangle represents the mean in figure. Tamil Nadu receives lowest rainfall among the subdivisions for the period.
